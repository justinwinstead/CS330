How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project provided me with 3D graphical design skills that I have never had to use prior to this course. I learned to design objects using primitive shapes and organize them using vectors in my scene. Also, I improved my ability to develop reusable functions like createShaderProgram for use throughout my project. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used an iterative approach where I outlined my functions and the overall structure of my project first. After this, I worked on each function and ensured that they illustrated the desired functionality. If they didn't, I worked with the code until it worked properly. Each week, I followed this framework to create a cohesive final program.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Iteration is essential to software development. My rigid approach should allow me to create software that meets user expectations and is relatively bug free. 

How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I was able to use OpenGL documentation and other resources to provide the knowledge I needed to create my scene. I used sound design fundamentals and code structure to ensure that my scene depicted the image I had chosen and was technically sound.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a large part of my development. The use of iteration allowed me to overcome many issues and bugs that I encountered. Iteration is incredibly important in software development as it is difficult to get everything right the first time.  

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach changed a lot throughout this process. Initially, I developed many functions that fit very specific niches. As I progressed, I was able to utilize the resources available to me to develop more general purpose functions that helped to bring my scene to life.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science continues to grow in importance in our rapidly evolving world. This field will help me to provide value to society and the firms that I will work for. Computers provide the framework for the world that we live in today. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course made me improve my problem-solving and design skills. These should help me as I learn new information as I will be able to troubleshoot issues more effectively. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This project forced me to learn that I will encounter difficult issues that may need collaboration with others (my instructor) to fix. I believe that this will allow me to work well with those around me to create structurally-sound, bug-free software in my professional endeavors.
